# How to Think Like a ComputerScientist: Learning with Python 3 Documentation

<br>

I found this [material](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/howtothink/latest/howtothink.pdf), however I didn't find any solutions. So I decided to share my own solutions, be aware some may be incorrect I'm by no means any expert in the matte, I also skipped some exercises and chapters. It's my second python book, this one is by far more intense and complex, but I have other things I want to study in mind.

I'm reading this book, and I'm also doing this [course taught by google engineers](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python--ud513) on Data Structures & Algorithms.
